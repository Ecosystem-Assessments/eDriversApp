"Gathering environmental data for large scale, systematic initiatives such as ecosystem-based management is a very challenging process. Building such holistic datasets is made increasingly possible through initiatives like the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) and Bio-ORACLE. Data on environmental drivers (*e.g.* climate change and fisheries) are however largely missing even though their characterization is crucial to a better understanding of the effects of multiple environmental threats. In this paper we discuss how we are addressing this issue by launching an open data platform called <i>eDrivers</i>, focused on characterizing and sharing data on the distribution and intensity of drivers and using the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence in eastern Canada as a case study. The core objective underlying this initiative is to create a community-led project built on a series of guiding principles aiming at upholding the highest standards of data management and open science. The platform currently shares data for 22 drivers including coastal, climate, fisheries and marine traffic related layers. Observations on drivers are destined to improve as *eDrivers* evolves through time to address gaps in knowledge, incorporates additional driver layers and refines the characterization of current driver layers. Ultimately, we believe that <i>eDrivers</i> represents a much needed solution that could radically influence broad scale research and management practices by increasing data accessibility and interoperability and by increasing research and decision-making efficiency. All that is required is a commitment to open data, adaptive monitoring and an integrated vision of ecosystem management."
